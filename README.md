## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App Idea:
I want to create an app that has aspects of social media, such as Instagram or Snapchat, but has a mission oriented goal - to help reduce climate change. Some features of the app would be: clean-up events that you can share with your friends and tracking your step count, which you can post to the platform. Climate change has become a real problem; I believe there can be apps that are just as fun as social media but also bring people together to solve ongoing problems.
